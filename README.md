🌾 AgriLens Kit

AI-Powered Intelligent Pesticide Sprinkling System

AgriLens Kit is a smart agriculture hardware solution that uses AI, IoT, and computer vision to detect crop type, diagnose plant diseases, assess infection severity, and perform targeted pesticide spraying. The system enables precision farming, reduces chemical overuse, and improves crop yield while ensuring farmer safety and environmental sustainability.

🚀 Key Highlights

✅ Two-stage AI pipeline: Crop Detection → Disease Classification

🎯 Targeted spraying only on infected plant regions

🌱 Reduced pesticide usage & environmental impact

📱 Farmer-friendly web/mobile dashboard

🌍 Globally scalable using FAO, EPPO & ICAR standards
